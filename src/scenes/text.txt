"Hi!"
"Cycle Game is a 2 Player Game"
"Here's Player 1 (Red)"
"And Here's Player 2 (Blue)"
"Both Players begin with 0 points..."
"and carbon spread around the board."
"The game takes place over 10 turns."
"Each turn has a few steps:"
"First, player 1 plays an event card."
"Then, player 2 plays an event card."
"Playing an event card moves carbon from one reservoir to another."
"After both cards have been played,"
"all the carbon at the \"
"as points to each player."
"The player with the most points at the end of 10 turns, wins."
"Ok. Let's go through a turn."
"Player 1 selects an event card to play by clicking on it."
"Then, they choose who to target with this card."
"After a quick confirmation..."
"Player 2 goes through the same motions."
"Choose an event card..."
"Choose a target..."
"Quick confirmation..."
"(Watch the goal reservoir after we click confirm...)"
"Some other things to look out for:"
"1. Every 3 turns, the goal reservoir will make a move through the cycle."
"2. Some cards move more than one carbon."
"3. Some cards take more than one turn to move carbon."
"Ok. You should be able to figure it out from here."
"Good luck!"
