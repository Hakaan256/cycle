Considerations:
- Any UI/Infrastructure must be universalizable across carbon, nitrogen, and water
- UI ought be usable via touch devices
  - Can't make use of hover
  - Need big, touchable buttons (or gestures)
- Game might be played in iframe
  - Shouldn't treat game as full browser web page- isolated rectangle more naturally iframe-able
- Full information game
  - That is, every player's cards/info must be visible at all times, from every player
    - (this way, we avoid the need to say "ok, now player 1 turn around" when doing shared screen multiplayer)

Necessary Information:
- What nodes exist
- How many of each player's tokens are on each node
  - Also, tokens can exist "between nodes" due to multi-turn events
- What event cards each player has
  - What nodes each event card affects (only for first half of game! viz must be toggleable)
  - The direction each event card moves tokens (only for first third of game! viz must be toggleable)
- Which node is the goal node
  - How much longer before goal node shifts
- Which player's turn it is
- Who the player is (It's one thing to know it's "the red player's turn"- it's another to know "you're the red player"- for a definition of "you" dependent on if there's a shared screen, a networked game, or playing an AI)
- The score
- The Current Turn # (out of how many total turns)
- The last played card (so a player doesn't miss what happened)
- The necessity of the edges between the nodes (currently black lines) is up for debate... could eperiment with that
- Probably a bit more...

Necessary Non-Information:
- Cards can only show specifics of what they do during the first parts of the game (if at all)

Necessary Interaction:
- Preview cards (of opponent and self)
- Choose card (on your turn)
- Choose target
- Confirm that a play has been chosen (before animation plays)
